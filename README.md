WebSocket-Based Chat Application

This project demonstrates a simple WebSocket-powered chat application. It establishes a persistent, bi-directional connection between a client and a server, allowing real-time communication similar to a chat room.

Bi-directional communication: Messages can be sent from both the client and the server.

Persistent connection: The connection remains open, enabling real-time updates.

Multi-user support: Multiple clients can connect to the server simultaneously, with random colors assigned to thier profiles!
