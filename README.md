WebSocket-Based Chat Application

This project demonstrates a simple WebSocket-powered chat application. It establishes a persistent, bi-directional connection between a client and a server, allowing real-time communication similar to a chat room.

Bi-directional communication: Messages can be sent from both the client and the server.

Persistent connection: The connection remains open, enabling real-time updates.

Multi-user support: Multiple clients can connect to the server simultaneously.

Usage:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/anjelica0224/websocket.git`
3. Navigate to the server directory. Start the server: Run the server script (`node server.js`).
4. Open the client: Access the client application (`index.html`) in multiple browsers.
5. Start chatting: Send messages from each browser, and they will be displayed in all connected clients.
